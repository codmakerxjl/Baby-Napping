# Exploit Report

## Executive Summary
The binary "code/vuln" was found to contain a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the unchecked use of the strcpy function in the process_input function. By providing a crafted input, it was possible to trigger a segmentation fault, confirming the presence of the vulnerability.

## Technical Deep-Dive
The vulnerable function process_input in the binary code/vuln uses the strcpy function without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to overwrite the buffer and potentially control the program's execution flow. This vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a payload that overflows the buffer and overwrites the return address.

## Detailed Exploitation Methodology
1. The vulnerable function process_input in the binary code/vuln was identified as the target for exploitation.
2. A payload was crafted to overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with a controlled value (e.g., "BBBB").
3. The exploit script was executed, providing the crafted payload as a command line argument to the binary.
4. The program crashed with a segmentation fault, indicating a successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability.

## Proof of Successful Exploitation
The program crashed with a segmentation fault, confirming the successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability.

This concludes the exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability in the binary code/vuln.
